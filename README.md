Spatiotemporal data visualization allows users to explore events and interactions over space and time, making it easier to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data. Glyph maps use specialized multivariate glyph plots that depict and summarize data at each spatial location over time. A variant of glyph maps, the line glyph, illustrates changes over time but falls short in capturing the diverse components of spatiotemporal data. To address this limitation, `sugarglider` extend glyph maps with ribbon and segment geometries to depict seasonal trends, variations, and data ranges.
