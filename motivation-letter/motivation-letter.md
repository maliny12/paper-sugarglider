Dear Dr. Van der Loo,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "sugarglider: Create Glyph-maps of Spatiotemporal Data" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `sugarglider` which extend glyph maps with ribbon and segment geometries to depict seasonal trends, variations, and data ranges.

We believe that readers of the R Journal will find this article valuable as it provides a concise description of the software's importance to exploratory data analysis and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this new contribution compared to existing implementations.
